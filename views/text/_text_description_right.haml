%p Each fabric is in limited supply, only a hand-full are made from each pattern so you can be sure your Smib will be quite unique.
%p Currently Smibs are only available here, through this website. We've worked hard to make this process fun and easy; just select a pattern from the current range, fill in postage details, and we'll send you an email. Once payment is received your Smib(s) will arrive at your doorstep shortly after. Pretty neat, eh?
