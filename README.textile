Smibs is almost a shop but more of a 'point of contact' to sell these bib/smock things I make on the sewing machine.

It's written very specific to my needs but you are welcome to use and wrangle it.

Specifically it is for one product the only variable in that product is the fabric pattern, therefore to use it for multiple product types you could add a price and description field to Fabrics, for example and umm you might want to change Fabrics to Products.. like I said it's specific to my needs.

It has no image uploads, I plan on scp'ing the images over to the server and typing the path to where the images are hosted rather than all the junk of uploads.

It has no validations on an order, because;
*I can.
*I HATE it when forms fail.
*Rather than rejecting an order and potentially loosing it for good, it gives me a hook for further communication and a potential sale, providing an email was provided.

Managing Smibs requires SmibsZen which I wrote as a separate Sinatra App, it connects to Smibs Database.
